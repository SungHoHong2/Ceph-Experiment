### makefile log
- I think the third part is the one atht will allow you `integrate Seastar`
- this is the result from `make ceph-osd -j`
- if the design is indeed centralized and the OSDs are only 1 : 1 relationship,
- then simply implementing Sestar with client or server is suffice
- use `sudocmd ceph_seastar_msg custom_makefile_test`

### integrating Seastar with Ceph
- use the common header file

### found issues with the BOOST version
- boost_1_67_0 is used by ceph
- boost 1.58.0 is used by seastar
- need to find a match

### bug found on the boost library in Ceph
- include/boost/lockfree/spsc_queue.hpp
- Add #include <boost/next_prior.hpp>; no longer in utility.hpp


### Need to recompile Seastar to work with shared libraries
- modify `build.ninja`
- recompile Seastar with -fPIC
- recompile Seastar-DPDK with -fPIC

  ### Problem with shared-libraries combined with Ceph.
  - /home/sungho/seastar/build/release/libcares-seastar.a  needs be compiled with -fPIC
  - [compile] build.ninja -j 4
  - build/release/c-ares/Makefile : carescmake_release c-ares
  - CMakeFiles/c-ares.dir/build.make CMakeFiles/c-ares.dir/ares_gethostbyaddr.c.o
  - build/release/c-ares/CMakeFiles
  - need to compile seastar library with `-fPIC`

  - /home/sungho/seastar/build/release/c-ares/CMakeFiles/c-ares.dir/build.make

  [ceph compile] cd /home/sungho/ceph/build/src
  cmake -E cmake_link_script CMakeFiles/ceph-osd.dir/link.txt --verbose=

  [seastar compile]
  vi /home/sungho/seastar/build/release/c-ares/CMakeFiles/c-ares.dir/build.make



### debug the configure.py
- https://github.com/scylladb/seastar/commit/f6d0de0ad4634cbf28e54cf0d5862ef9e8eab5ba
- add set (CMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE TRUE) at the start of c-ares/CMakeLists.txt
- ./configure.py --enable-dpdk --compiler g++-5 --mode release --disable-hwloc --cflags="-DSEASTAR_DEFAULT_ALLOCATOR -fPIC"


### duplicated usage of DPDK in Seastar and Ceph
- Ceph also have DPDK. we need to remove this and use the DPDK ins the seastar
- [Attempt #1] Trying to link the DPDK that is used in Ceph.


```
sudo ./configure.py --enable-dpdk --compiler g++-5
sudo ./configure.py --enable-dpdk --compiler g++-5 --mode release --cflags="-fPIC"
sudo ./configure.py --so --enable-dpdk --compiler g++-5 --mode release --cflags="-fPIC"
./configure.py --enable-dpdk --compiler g++-5 --mode release --disable-hwloc --cflags="-DSEASTAR_DEFAULT_ALLOCATOR -fPIC"


problem is we don't support building seastar as a shared library. That option is deprecated and should be removed.
deprecated version of seastar only supports shared-library version
moving on tot he commit
```
