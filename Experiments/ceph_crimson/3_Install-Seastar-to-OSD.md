### makefile log
- I think the third part is the one atht will allow you `integrate Seastar`
- this is the result from `make ceph-osd -j`
- if the design is indeed centralized and the OSDs are only 1 : 1 relationship,
- then simply implementing Sestar with client or server is suffice
- use `sudocmd ceph_seastar_msg custom_makefile_test`

### integrating Seastar with Ceph
- use the common header file

### found issues with the BOOST version
- boost_1_67_0 is used by ceph
- boost 1.58.0 is used by seastar
- need to find a match

### bug found on the boost library in Ceph
- include/boost/lockfree/spsc_queue.hpp
- Add #include <boost/next_prior.hpp>; no longer in utility.hpp


### Need to recompile Seastar to work with shared libraries
- modify `build.ninja`
- recompile Seastar with -fPIC
- recompile Seastar-DPDK with -fPIC
