desktop/07529537.pdf
- Focused on `Meta Data Server == Ceph MDS` Â 
- Ceph metadata management subsystem is upgraded
- The log cache backup scheme
  - reduces metadata access delay
  - by caching logs and reducing the time of storing logs to server clusters.
- cached data backup scheme
  - prevent the loss of cached data in metadata servers

### A Data Deduplication Method in the Cloud Storage Based on FP-tree
- delete the underlying redundant data in cloud storage.
- save large amount of disk space
- combined with cloud storage hash location function




### Wenji's work
- use non volatile memory
- which was also mentioned in the paper from Purdue
- async-messenger has the performance when used with RDMA.
