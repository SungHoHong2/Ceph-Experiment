### Weekly Report Objective
- Implement Cache with Fuse
- Integrate Fuse with Seastar
- Test performance on all filesystem


### Learning FUSE
- combine seastar with FUSE
- calculate the time-latency created by FUSE

sudo apt-get install libfuse-dev

FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) is an interface that let you write your own filesystem for Linux in the user space
`Actually you canâ€™t build a native filesystem which can store data to disk directly`
Instead you need to use an already exist filesystem to do so
for example GDFS is a filesystem which let you mount your Google Drive in your system and access the files there as normal files
