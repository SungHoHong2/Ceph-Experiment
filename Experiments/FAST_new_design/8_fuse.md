### list
- [] first test pure DPDK and POSIX and confirm that the performance is better than POSIX
- [] combine pass-through example which is a low level interface of FUSE with DPDK and POSIX
- [] just compile FUSE with DPDK and FUSE with POSIX (without synchronization) and compare the performance
- [] identify whether the performance degrades from synchronization between DPDK and FUSE or the network latency.
