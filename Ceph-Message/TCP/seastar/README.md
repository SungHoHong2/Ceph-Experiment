### Seastar Tutorial
- [seastar threads](tutorialthreads.c)
- future and continuations
  - building blocks of asynchronous programming
  - `future` is a result of a computation that may not be available yet.
  - `continuation` is a callback (typically a lambda) to run when a future becomes available
