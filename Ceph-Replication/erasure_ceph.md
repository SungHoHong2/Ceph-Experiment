# [Sprout: A Functional Caching Approach to Minimize Service Latency in Erasure-Coded Storage](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8048491)


### Abstract
- Modern distributed storage systems often use erasure codes to protect against disk and node failures to increase reliability
- while trying to meet the latency requirements of the applications and clients

- a novel caching framework with erasure code called functional caching.
  - an optimal functional caching placement
  - the access probabilities of the file request from different disks
