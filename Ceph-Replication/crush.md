### Crush
- [CRUSH: Controlled, Scalable, Decentralized Placement of Replicated Data](https://ceph.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/weil-crush-sc06.pdf)

**basics**
- pseudo random
  - fast calculation, no lookup
  - repeatable, deterministic

- statistically uniform distribution
- stable mapping
  - limited data migration on change
- rule based CONFIGURATION
  - infrastructure topology aware adjustable replication and weighting


<br>

**how crush finds the key**
- all the calculation is done within the client

<br>

**replication**
- if there is a node failure
- the osds are constantly watching the situation
- `you throw the basketball and the hoop moves to the right direction`
- client has a way of find the way and the server has a way of organizing the data


<br>

**layered block device**
- makes a copied layer of the data and the client will read from the copy
- this part is one of the unqiue way of ceph


<br>


**introdution of ceph**

-  each file’s data is typically striped across a relatively small number of named objects distributed throughout the storage cluster

- Objects are replicated across multiple devices (or employ some other data redundancy scheme) in order to protect against data loss in the presence of failures.



<br>

**using pseudo random code for data distribution**
- Most systems simply write new data to underutilized devices.
- The fundamental problem with this approach is that data is rarely, if ever, moved once it is written
- A robust solution is to distribute all data in a system randomly among available storage devices


<br>

**problems with pseudo random**
- simple hashbased distribution fails to cope with changes in the number of devices, incurring a massive reshuffling of data
- existing randomized distribution schemes that decluster replication by spreading each disk’s replicas across many other devices suffer from a high probability of data loss from coincident device failures.


<br>


**introducing CRUSH**

- CRUSH needs only a compact, hierarchical description of the devices comprising the storage cluster and knowledge of the replica placement policy


- it is completely distributed such that any party in a large system can independently calculate the location of any object;


- little metadata is required is mostly static, changing only when devices are added or removed.

<br>

**Crush supports variety of safety mechanisms**
- n-way replication (mirroring)
- RAID parity
- schemes or other forms of erasure coding
- hybrid approaches (e. g., RAID-10).
