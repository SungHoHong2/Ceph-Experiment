### Crush
- [CRUSH: Controlled, Scalable, Decentralized Placement of Replicated Data](https://ceph.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/weil-crush-sc06.pdf)

**basics**
- pseudo random
  - fast calculation, no lookup
  - repeatable, deterministic

- statistically uniform distribution
- stable mapping
  - limited data migration on change
- rule based CONFIGURATION
  - infrastructure topology aware adjustable replication and weighting


<br>

**how crush finds the key**
- all the calculation is done within the client

<br>

**replication**
- if there is a node failure
- the osds are constantly watching the situation
- `you throw the basketball and the hoop moves to the right direction`
- client has a way of find the way and the server has a way of organizing the data


<br>

**layered block device**
- makes a copied layer of the data and the client will read from the copy
- this part is one of the unqiue way of ceph


<br>


**introdution of ceph**

-  each file’s data is typically striped across a relatively small number of named objects distributed throughout the storage cluster

- Objects are replicated across multiple devices (or employ some other data redundancy scheme) in order to protect against data loss in the presence of failures.



<br>

**using pseudo random code for data distribution**
- Most systems simply write new data to underutilized devices.
- The fundamental problem with this approach is that data is rarely, if ever, moved once it is written
- A robust solution is to distribute all data in a system randomly among available storage devices


<br>

**problems with pseudo random**
- simple hashbased distribution fails to cope with changes in the number of devices, incurring a massive reshuffling of data
- existing randomized distribution schemes that decluster replication by spreading each disk’s replicas across many other devices suffer from a high probability of data loss from coincident device failures.


<br>


**introducing CRUSH**

- CRUSH needs only a compact, hierarchical description of the devices comprising the storage cluster and knowledge of the replica placement policy


- it is completely distributed such that any party in a large system can independently calculate the location of any object;


- little metadata is required is mostly static, changing only when devices are added or removed.

<br>

**Crush supports variety of safety mechanisms**
- n-way replication (mirroring)
- RAID parity
- schemes or other forms of erasure coding
- hybrid approaches (e. g., RAID-10).


<br>

**CRUSH Algorithm**
- SH algorithm distributes data objects among storage devices according to a per-device weight value,
- The distribution is controlled by a hierarchical cluster map
- The data distribution policy is defined in terms of placement rules
- CRUSH generates a declustered distribution of replicas in that the set of devices sharing replicas for one item also appears to be independent of all other items.

<br>

**Hierarchical CLuster Map**
- The cluster map is composed of devices and buckets
- Buckets can contain any number of devices  allowing them to form interior nodes in a storage hierarchy in which devices are always at the leaves.
- Storage devices are assigned weights by the administrator to control the relative amount of data they are responsible for storing

- Bucket weights are defined as the sum of the weights of the items they contain.
- , CRUSH is based on four different bucket types, each with a different selection algorithm to address data movement resulting from the addition or removal of devices and overall computational complexity.

<br>

**Replica Placement**

- designed to distribute data uniformly among weighted devices to maintain a statistically balanced utilization of storage and device bandwidth resources
- By encoding this information into the cluster map, CRUSH placement policies can separate object replicas across different failure domains while still maintaining the desired distribution
- . For example, to address the possibility of concurrent failures, it may be desirable to ensure that data replicas are on devices in different shelves, racks, power supplies, controllers, and/or physical locations

<br>

-  defines placement rules for each replication strategy
-  distribution policy employed that allow the storage system or administrator to specify exactly how object replicas are placed.

<br>

**Algorithm 1**

- `x`, is typically an object name or other identifier, such as an identifier for a group of objects whose replicas will be placed on the same devices.

- The `take(a)` operation selects an item (typically a bucket) within the storage hierarchy and assigns it to the vector~i, which serves as an input to subsequent operations.

- The `select(n,t)` operation iterates over each element i ∈~i, and chooses n distinct items of type t in the subtree rooted at that point.
