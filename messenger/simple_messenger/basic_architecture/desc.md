### Simple Messenger
```
/*
 * This class handles transmission and reception of messages. Generally
 * speaking, there are several major components:
 *
 * - Connection
 *    Each logical session is associated with a Connection.
 * - Pipe
 *    Each network connection is handled through a pipe, which handles
 *    the input and output of each message.  There is normally a 1:1
 *    relationship between Pipe and Connection, but logical sessions may
 *    get handed off between Pipes when sockets reconnect or during
 *    connection races.
 * - IncomingQueue
 *    Incoming messages are associated with an IncomingQueue, and there
 *    is one such queue associated with each Pipe.
 * - DispatchQueue
 *    IncomingQueues get queued in the DIspatchQueue, which is responsible
 *    for doing a round-robin sweep and processing them via a worker thread.
 * - SimpleMessenger
 *    It's the exterior class passed to the external message handler and
 *    most of the API details.
 *
 * Lock ordering:
 *
 *   SimpleMessenger::lock
 *       Pipe::pipe_lock
 *           DispatchQueue::lock
 *               IncomingQueue::lock

### How does Ceph write object
1. Get the Admin keyring
2. initialize rados object
3. set up rados with the configuration from the ceph.conf file
4. connect by invoking `rados_connect`
    1. reads the required info from the configuration file
    2. read the monitor information from monitor map
    3. initialize a `client messenger` **what does this client messenger do**
    4. set policy for the client messenger
    5. initialize `objecter` **is objector used for all purposess**
        1. pass configuration file as a argument
        2. pass messenger as a argument
        3. pass monitor as a argument
    6. set objecter with balanced budget   
    7. set monitor with messenger pointer
    8. set manager with messenger pointer
    9. initializze objector
    10. assign mgr client client in the dispatcher head of the messenger
    11. assign objecter in the dispatcher tail of the messenger
    12. assign rados connect in the dispatcher tail of the messenger
    13. start messenger
    14. set monitor with keys
    15. initialize monitor client
    16. initialize mgr client
    17. `objecter` start
    18. lock
    19. timer start
    20. finisher start
    21. assign global id from monitor client
5. add hello data in the bufferlist
6. run `ioctx.write_full` to submit data in the object pool
    1. lock
    2. check version
    3. run C_SafeCond and assign it with a lock
    4. objecter runs prepare_mutate_op **is this a snapshot the function?**
    5. objector runs op_submit
        1. lock read and write
        2. run op_submit with budget
        3. calculate the latest map for the latest map **RECALC_OP_TARGET_POOL_DNE**
        4. check the request is either read or write
        5. run `_send_op`  to send the data
            1. prepare OSD operation
            2. get the connection reference which is the `Pipeconnection`
            3. run `Simple Connection` to send message
            4. get the destination from messenger
            5. lock
            6. look up pipe with destination address **how the pipeline works?**
            7. submit message using a pipe
            8. unlock
        6. unlock the read and write lock
        7. free the session
    6. wait unti lthe C-SafeCon is finished
    7. sync operation version
